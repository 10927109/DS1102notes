### (2) Min-max Heap 實作
* DEPQ
![](https://i.imgur.com/svQ8BGl.png)
* 動作
    * Insert any **key**.
    * Delete the **smallest key**.
    * Delete the **largest key**.
* 插入 Insert
    1. Decide which level (min / max).
    2. Check whether to swap with its parent.
        * Yes - ReheapUp from **the current node**.
        * No  - ReheapUp from **its parent**.
* 刪除最小 Delete the Smallest
    1. Replace the root with the last element.
    2. Check whether to swap with its smaller child.
        * ReheapDown frrom the **root** (recursion).
* 刪除最大 Delete the Largest
    1. Replace the maximum with the last element.
    2. Check whether to swap with its larger child.
        * ReheapDown frrom the **the current node** (recursion).
* Main Idea in Min-max Heap
    * Three 4-way trees
        * max heap + min heap + max heap
        * Each node in ==max heap== has its parent in ==min heap==.

* Search trees can retain their **balance** despite insertions and deletions.

    * AVL Tree
    * Red-Black Tree

---

### (3) 2-3 Tree
* Definition
    * All external nodes(leaves) are at the **same level**.
    * General Tree.
    * 2-3 tree with n nodes never has height greater than log~2~(n + 1)
    * Degree of each internal node = **2** or **3** .
        * **2-node (1 data + 2 children)**
        * **3-node (2 data + 3 children)**
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/FMmjKRh.png)
* Main Operations
    * Search (BST)
    * Insertion
    * Deletion
* Node
    * 2-node contains **a single data item** whose search key S satisfies :
        * S > the **left** child's search keys.
        * S < the **right** child's search keys.
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/Bk0LDyl.png)
    * 3-node contains **two data items** whose search keys S and L satisfy :
        * S > the **left** child's search keys.
        * S < the **middle** child's search keys.
        * L > the **middle** child's search keys.
        * L < the **right** child's search keys.
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/OO5yYA2.png)
* Operations
    * Traverse
    * Search
        * O(log~2~n)
    * Insertion
        * Insert an item I into a 2-3 tree.
        1. Locate the **leaf** at which the search for I would terminate.
        2. Insert the new item I into the leaf.
        3. If the **leaf** now contains only **2** items, done.
        4. If the **leaf** now contains **3** items, **split** the leaf into 2 nodes, n1 and n2.
    * Deletion
        * Delete an item I from a 2-3 tree.
        1. Locate the **leaf** at which the seach for I would terminate.
        2. Delete I from the leaf.
        3. If the **leaf** now contains **1** item, done.
        4. If the **leaf** now contains **no** item, choose one of the following operations to fix.
            (a) **Redistribute the values (3-node)** : retain the tree structure.
            (b) **Merge into a leaf (2-node)** : its parent has one less child.
        * If I is an **internal node**, swapping with **in-order successor** on a leaf.
* Summary
    * **Searching** a 2-3 tree is **not more efficient** than a BST of minimum height.
        * The 2-3 tree might be shorter, but that advantage is offset by the extra comparisons in a 3-node.
    * **Maintaining the balance** of a 2-3 tree is relatively easy.
        * Maintaining the balance if a BST is difficult.

---

### (4) 2-3-4 Tree
* Definition
    * All external nodes(leaves) are at the **same level**.
    * General Tree.
    * 2-3-4 trees are never taller than 2-3 trees.
    * Degree of each internal node = **2** or **3** or **4** .
        * **2-node (1 data + 2 children)**
        * **3-node (2 data + 3 children)**
        * **4-node (3 data + 4 children)**
* Split
    * 2-3-4 tree split **4-nodes** during **insertion**.

* Deletion
    1. Locate the node n that contains the item.
    2. Find it's **inorder successor** and swap it with the item.
    3. If that leaf is **a 3-node** or **4-node**, remove the item.
    * To ensure that item does not occur in a 2-node, **transform** each 2-node into a 3-node or 4-node.
* Summary
    * Insertion or Deletion algorithms for a 2-3-4 tree require **fewer steps** than those for a 2-3 tree(only one pass from root to leaf).
    * Always **balance**.
    * Requiring **more storage** than a binary search tree.
    * Allowing nodes with **more** data and children is counterproductive, unless the tree is in **external storage**.
    * A 2-3 tree and a 2-3-4 tree are variants of a BST in which nodes contain **more than one data item** and have **more than two children**.
    * Balance is easily maintained.
    * Insertion and deletion of 2-3-4 tree are more **efficient** than 2-3 tree.

## 單元 4 平衡二元樹 Top Down Balanced Binary Search Tree

### (1) AVL Tree
* Definition
    * Balance Binary Search Tree
    * Can be search almost as efficiently as a **minimum-height** binaey search tree.
    * Maintains the tree height **close** to the minimum.
* Main Idea
    1. Check whether the tree is still **balance**.
    2. If the tree is unbalanced, **rotate** to restore the balance.
* Balance Factor
    * BF = h(left subtree) - h(right subtree)
    * -1 <= BF of any nodes in AVL tree <= 1
* Rotate
    * Single Rotation
        * node x
        * **BF(x) = +2** and **BF(x->left) = +1 or 0**
        * **BF(x) = -2** and **BF(x->left) = -1 or 0**
    * Double Rotation
        * node x
        * **BF(x) = +2** and **BF(x->left) = -1**
        * **BF(x) = -2** and **BF(x->left) = +1**

---

### (2) Red-Black Tree
* Definition
    * Every **external path** has an **equal** number of black pointers.
    * External path **cannot** have two **consecutive red** pointers.
    * External pointer must be **black**.
    * Every pointer to a new added node must be red.
* Representations
    * 4-node
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/wlKKMrm.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/cbJSUNk.png)
    * 3-node
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Btgl0cp.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/DjfKQfH.png)
* Split
    * Split 
    * Parent **black -> red**
    * Children **red -> black**
    * Consecutive red -> **rotate**
* Insertion
    1. Splits of a node with two **red** pointers occur only on the path from the root to a leaf.
    2. Set the pointer to a **new** added node as **red**.
    3. Rotate if there are teo **consecutive red** pointers.
* Deletion
    1. Find the node to delete, as in a BST.
    2. Replace the node of only one child with its child.
    3. Delete the leaf if the pointer to it is red.
    4. **Recolor** or **rotate**.
