 ## 單元1 : 優先佇列
 ### 簡介 :
**原理** : 額外有個東西可以決定佇列裡的優先順序。
### 堆積(Heap) : 
 **最小堆積(min-Heap) :**

**最大堆積(max-Heap) :**

**What is a heap?**
It is a binary tree with the following properties--
(1)It is a <font color="#f00">complete binary tree</font> 
(2)The value stored at a node is <font color="#72EF4C">greater(smaller) or equal to</font> the value stored at the children(heap property)

**How to build a heap?**
```clike=1
template<class ItemType>
    struct HeapType{
        void ReheapDown(int, int) ;
        void ReheapUp(int, int) ;
        ItemType *elements ;
        int numElements ; // heap elements
    } ;

```
ReheapUp Funtion :

<font color="#72EF4C">Insert a new element</font> into the heap :
(1) Insert the new element int the <font color="#f00">next </font><font color="#4093D1 ">bottom rightmost</font> place
(2) Fix the heap property by calling ***ReheapUp***
        
ReheapDown Funtion :
![](https://i.imgur.com/DYcCxid.png)

Remove the ***largest*** element from the heap :
(1) Copy the bottom rightmost element to the root 
(2) Delete the bottom rightmost node
(3) Fix the heap property by calling ***ReheapDown***

### 堆積排序(heap sort)
bool heapIsEmpty()
void heapInsert( HeapItemType& newItem )
// Insert anb item into a heap
void heapDelete( HeapItemType& rootItem )
// Retrieves and deletes yhe item in  the root of a heap
void heapRebuild( int <font color="#924BB8 ">root</font> )
// Converts the semi-heap rooted at index <font color="#924BB8 ">root</font> into heap
HeapItemType items[MAX_HEAP] ;
// Arrays of heap items
int size ;
// Number of heap items

## 單元2 : 堆積變形
### Variation of Heap
**雙向優先佇列 :**
--Min-max Heap
--Double ended Heap(DEAP)

### Min-max Heap
![](https://i.imgur.com/WnyrC91.png)
**Insert :**
(1) Decide which level -> min or max
(2) Check whether to swap with its parent

**Delete the smallest :**
(1) Replace the **root** with the *last* element
(2) Check whether to swap with its **smaller** child

**Delete the largest :**
(1) Replace the **maximum** with the *last* element
(2) Check whether to swap with its **larger** child

### DEAP
![](https://i.imgur.com/IVDY78T.png)
**Insert :**
(1) Examine the corresponding nodes : **Left < Right** 
(2) ***ReheapUp*** if necessary (recursion)

**Delete the smallest :**
(1) Replace **the root of min-heap** with the *last* element
(2) ***ReheapDown*** if necessary 
(3) Examine the corresponding nodes : **Left < Right** 

**Delete the largest :**
(1) Replace **the root of max-heap** with the *last* element
(2) ***ReheapDown*** if necessary 
(3) Examine the corresponding nodes : **Left < Right**

## 單元3 : 由下而上成長的平衡二元樹
### Balanced Search Tree :
**2-3 Tree**
- All external nodes(leaves) are at the same level
-- 2-nodes
- Degree of each internal code = 2 or 3
-- 3-nodes
- Main operations
-- Search == Binary Search Tree
-- Insertion 
-- Deletion
![](https://i.imgur.com/KV4NfAY.png)

**To insert an item I into a 2-3 tree :**
1. Locate the leaf at which the search for I would terminate
2. Insert the new item I into the leaf
3. If the leaf now contains only two items, you are done
4. If the leaf now contains three items, split the leaf into two nodes, n1 and n2

**Cases :**
- When an internal node contains three items (recursion)
-- Split the node into two nodes
-- Accommodate the node's children
- When the root contains three items
-- Split the root into two nodes
-- Create a new root node
-- Tree grows in height

**2-3-4 Tree**
- 2-3-4 trees have 2-nodes, 3-nodes, and 4-nodes
-- A 2-node has one data item and two children
-- A 3-node has two data items and three children
-- A 4-node has three data items and four children
- Are general trees, not binary trees
- Are never taller than a 2-3 tree
- Search and traversal algorithms for a 2-3-4 tree are simple extensions of the corresponding algorithms for a 2-3 tree

**Split 4-node during Insertion :**
- The insertion algorithm for a 2-3-4 tree
-- Split a 4-node by moving the middle item up to its parent node
-- Split 4-nodes as soon as its encounters them during a search from the root to a leaf (downward)
- A 4-node that is split will eventually become
-- the root, or the parent of a 2-node or 3-node
- Impact
-- When a 4-node is split, its parent cannot possibly be a 4-node (recursion), so it can accommodate the item moved up from the 4-node.

## 單元4 : 由下而上成長的平衡二元樹(2)
### AVL Tree
- An AVL tree
-- A balanced <font color="#3B97FA  ">binary search tree</font> 
-- Can be searched almost as efficiently as a <font color="#f000  ">minimum-height</font>  binary search tree
-- Maintains the tree height <font color="#f000  ">close</font> to the minimum

**Main idea :**
- After each insertion or deletion
  1. Check whether the tree is still <font color="#C162F4 ">balanced</font>
  2. If the tree is unbalanced, <font color="#C162F4 ">rotate</font> to restore the balance

- After <font color="#52F46C ">each</font> insertion or deletion
    1. Check whether the tree is still <font color="#C162F4 ">balanced</font> 
- Balance Factor (BF)
    </font><font color="#4093D1 ">BF(a node) = h(left subtree) - h (right subtree)</font>
-- The heights of the left and right subtrees of any node in a binary search tree differ by no more than 1.

**Property :**
1. Check whether the tree is still <font color="#C162F4 ">balanced</font>
<font color="#4093D1 ">BF(a node) = h(left subtree) - h (right subtree)</font>
-- The heights of the left and right subtrees of any node in a binary search tree differ by at most 1.

**Rotations :**
- Since an insertion/deletion involves adding/deleting a single node, this can only increase/decrease the height of some subtree by <font color="#f00">1</font>
- Thus, if the AVL tree property is violated at a node y, it means that the heights of left(x) ad right(x) differ <font color="#f00">by exactly 2</font>.
- Rotations will be applied to y to restore the A VL tree property.

**Actions :**
- After <font color="#52F46C ">each</font> insertion or deletion
    <font color="#B7B6B8">1. Check whether the tree is still balanced</font>
    2. If the tree is unbalanced, <font color="#C162F4 ">rotate</font> to restore the balance 
    
    Rotations to restore the balance property
    -- Single rotation
    <font color="#f000">--Double rotation</font>
1. If the tree is unbalanced, rotate to restore the balance
-- Single rotation
-- Double rotation

**Insertion :**
1. Insert the new key as a new leaf just as in a binary search tree
2. Trace the path <font color="#f000">*from the new leaf towards the root*</font>. 
    <font color="#3B97FA ">- For each node x encountered, check if the heights
        of left(x) and right(x) differ by</font> <font color="#FA9A3B ">at most 1</font>.

       - If <font color="#f000">NOT</font>, restructure by either a <font color="#52F46C ">single rotation</font> or a <font color="#f000">double rotation</font>
3. Once we perform a rotation at a node x, the insertion is done!
    <font color="#3B97FA ">- We won't need to perform any rotation at any ancestor of x</font>
    
**Single rotation :**
- Let x be the node at which x->left and x->right differ
<font color="#FA9A3B ">by more than 1</font>; Assume that the height of x is 3
-- Height of r->left is 2 (i.e. height of x->right is 0)
     1. Height of x-›left->left: 1 -> single rotation with the left child (<font color="#FA9A3B ">LL</font>)
    - BF(x) = +2
    - BF(x->left) = +1 or 0

- Let x be the node at which x->left and x->right differ
<font color="#FA9A3B ">by more than 1</font>; Assume that the height of r is <font color="#B93BFA  ">h+3</font>
-- Heights of two subtrees: <font color="#B93BFA  ">h+2, h</font>
    1. Height of x->left->left: h+1, x->left-›right: h or h+1 =
single rotation with the left child (<font color="#FA9A3B ">LL</font>)
    - BF(x) = +2----------BF(x->left) = +1 or 0
    
    
    2. Height of x->right->right: h+1, x->right->left: h or h+1 -› single rotation with the right child (<font color="#FA9A3B ">RR</font>)
    - BF(x) = <font color="#f000  ">-2</font>-----------BF(x->right) =-1 or 0
    
**Double Rotations :**
- Let x be the node at which x->left and x->right differ<font color="#FA9A3B "> by more than 1</font>; Assume that the height of x is 3
-- Height of x->left is 2 (i.e. height of x->right is 0)
    
    3. Height of x->left->right: 1 > double rotation with the left child (<font color="#FA9A3B ">LR</font>)
    - BF(x) = <font color="#3B97FA ">+2</font>-----------BF(x->left) = <font color="#f000  ">-1</font>
- Let t be the node at which r->left and r->right differ <font color="#FA9A3B ">by more than 1</font>; Assume that the height of x is 3
-- Height of r-›right is 2 (i.e. height of r->left is 0)
   
   4. Height of ->right->left: 1 = double rotation with the right child (RL)
    - BF(x) = -2------------BF(x->right) = +1

- Let.r be the node at which r->left and x->right differ
by more than 1; Assume that the height of r is h+3
-- Heights of two subtrees: h+2, h
    
    3. Height of x->left->right: h+1 => double rotation with the left child (R): RR) LL
BF(x) = +2, BF(«->left) = -1
    4. Height of x->right->left: h+1 => double rotation with the right child (RL): LL > RR
BF(x) = -2, BF(x->right) = +1

### Red-black Tree
- A red-black tree
-- Represent each 3-node and 4-node in a 2-3-4 tree as an equivalent binary search tree
-- A binary search tree to represent a 2-3-4 tree

    - Maybe skewed & rotations like AVL tree
    
    -- Has the advantages of a 2-3-4 tree, without the storage overhead

    - Easy to keep balanced and simple insertion/deletion

```clike = 1
class RBTreeNode{
    TreeItemType item ;
    RBTreeNode* leftChildPtr, rightChildPtr;
    colorType leftColor, rightColor;
} ;
```
