- **Basics of Priority Queues**

    ![](https://img.onl/TZYHKr)

- **Heap**
    - Heap is a binary tree with the following properties : 
        property 1 : it is a compelete binary tree.
        property 2 : the value stored at a node is greater(smaller) or equal to the values stored at the children.
    
    - Largest Heap element = Root

    - How to build a tree :
        ![](https://img.onl/c7le)

    - Insert a new element into the heap :
        1: Insert the new element in the next buttom rightmost place.
        2: Fix the heap property by calling ReheapUp.
    
    - Remove the largest element from the heap :
        1: Copy the buttom rightmost element to the root.
        2: Delete the buttom rightmost node.
        3: Fix the heap property by calling ReHeapDown.

## 單元3:由下而上成長的平衡二元樹
### 大綱:

**1.** **2-3 tree**
**2.** **2-3-4 tree**

- **2-3 tree** 

    **Placing data items in a 2-3 tree**
    - Have 2-nodes and 3-nodes

    - A 2-nodes contains a single data item whose search key Satisfies the following : 
        - S > the left child's search key(s)
        - S < the right child's search key(s)
  
    - A 3-nodes contains two data item whose search key S and L satisfy the following : 
        - S > the left child's search key(s)
        - S < the middle child's search key(s)
        - L > the middle child's search key(s)
        - L < the right child's search key(s)
  
    - A leaf may contain either one or two data items
        ![](https://img.onl/B5kWVB)
        
    **2-3 tree: Operations**
    - To travel a 2-3 tree
    
    - Searching a 2-3 tree is as efficient as searching the shortest binary searching tree

    - Insertion into a 2-node leaf is simple

    - Insertion into a 3-node causes it to divide

    **Insertion into a 2-3 tree: Steps**
    - To insert an item I into a 2-3 tree : 
        1. Locate the leaf at which the search for I would terminate
        2. insert the new item I into the leaf
        3. If the leaf now contains only two items, you are done
        4. If the leaf now contains three items, split the leaf into two nodes, n1 and n2

    **Insertion into a 2-3 tree: Cases**
    - When an internal node contains three items(recursion) : 
        - split the node into two nodes.
        - Accommodate the node's children.
    
    - When the root contains three items : 
        - split the root into two nodes.
        - Create a new root node.
        - Tree grows in height.

    **Deleting from a 2-3 tree: Steps**
    - To delete an item I from a 2-3 tree : 
        1. Locate the leaf at which the search for I would terminate
        2. Delete I from the leaf
        3. If the leaf now contains ont item, you are done
        4. If the leaf now ccontains no item, choose one of the following operations to fix : 
          (a) Redistribute the values : retain the tree structure.
          (b) Merge into a leaf : this parent has one less child.
      
    **Deleting from a 2-3 tree: Cases**
    - When an internal node contains no item : 
       -  Redistribute the values and children.
        - Merge into an internal node.
    
    - When the root contains no item : 
        - Delete the root.
    
- **2-3-4 tree**

    - 2-3-4 tree Have 2-nodes,3-nodes and 4-nodes
        2-node has one data item and two children
        3-node has two data items and three children
        4-node has three data items and four children
        
    - Are general trees, not binary trees

    - Are never taller than a 2-3 tree

    - Search and traversal algorithms for a 2-3-4 tree are simple extensions of the corresponding algorithms for a 2-3 tree 

    **Placing data items in a 2-3-4 tree**
    - A leaf can contain either one, two or three data items
    ![](https://img.onl/DGRYv5)
    
    **2-3-4 tree: Split 4-nodes during Insertion**
    - The insertion algorithm for a 2-3-4 tree : 
        - Split a 4-node by moving the middle item up to its parent node.
        - Split 4-nodes as soon as its encounters them during a search from the root to a leaf (downward).

    - A 4-node that is split will eventually become : 
        - the root, or the parent of a 2-node or 3-node.

    - Impact : 
        - When a 4-node is split, its parent cannot possibly be a 4-node (recursion), so it can accommodate the item moved up from the 4-node.

    ![](https://img.onl/pL2Qd8)
    ![](https://img.onl/M3P3tv)
    
    - Splits occur only at the path from the root to a leaf (downward)!

    - No upward recursion is needed!

    **Deleting from a 2-3-4 Tree**
    1. Locate the node n that contains the item theItem
    2. Find theItem’s inorder successor and swap it with theItem (deletion will always occur at a leaf)
    3. If that leaf is a 3-node or a 4-node, remove theItem

    - To ensure that theItem does not occur in a 2-node : 
        Transform Transform each 2-node encountered into a 3-node or a 4-node.
        Apply the appropriate transformation for splitting nodes during insertions, but in reverse.
        
    **Transform 2-nodes during Deletion**
    ![](https://img.onl/a2uaSv)
    ![](https://img.onl/IglN0x)
    
    - Transformations occur only at thepath from the root to a leaf (downward)!

    - No upward recursion is needed!

    **2-3-4 Tree: Summary**
    - Insertion/deletion algorithms for a 2-3-4 tree require fewer steps than those for a 2-3 tree

    - A 2-3-4 tree is always balanced

    - A 2-3-4 tree requires more storage than a binary search tree

    - Allowing nodes with more data and children is counterproductive, unless the tree is in external external storage


## 單元4:由上而下成長的平衡二元樹
### 大綱:

**1.** **AVL tree**
**2.** **Red-Black tree**

- **AVL tree** 

    **An AVL tree**
        - A balanced binary search tree
        - Can be searched almost as efficiently as a minimum-height binary search tree
        - Maintains the tree height close to the minimum

    **AVL Tree: Main Idea**
    - After each insertion or deletion
        1. Check whether the tree is still Check whether the tree is still balanced
        2. If the tree is unbalanced, If the tree is unbalanced, rotate to restore the to restore the balance

    - Balance Factor (BF) : 
        BF(a node) = h(left subtree) – h(right subtree).
        ![](https://img.onl/yYcIEJ)

    **AVL Tree: Property**
    - Check whether the tree is still Check whether the tree is still balanced : 
        BF(a node) = h(left subtree) – h(right subtree)
        ![](https://img.onl/jqiq53)
        
    **Rotations**
    - Since an insertion/deletion involves adding/deleting a single node, this can only increase/decrease the height of some subtree by 1
    
    - Thus, if the AVL tree property is violated at a node x, it means that the heights of left(x) ad right(x) differ by exactly 2

    - Rotations will be applied to x to restore the AVL tree property

    **AVL Tree: Actions**
    - If the tree is unbalanced, rotate to restore the balance to restore the balance Rotations to restore the balance property : 
        -Single rotation Single rotation
        -Double rotation Double rotation
        ![](https://img.onl/pvuUBj)
        
    **AVL Tree: Insertion**
    - Insert the new key as a new leaf just as in a binary search tree

    - Trace the path from the new leaf towards the root

    - Once we perform a rotation at a node Once we perform a rotation at a node x, the insertion is done! insertion is done!

    **AVL Tree: Single Rotations**
    **LL :** 
    ![](https://img.onl/KX6IQ6)
    ![](https://img.onl/ugOWQ0)
    **RR :** 
    ![](https://img.onl/sbGLU)
    ![](https://img.onl/Hc5u8)
    
    **AVL Tree: Double Rotations**
    **LR :** 
    ![](https://img.onl/PD5Uc3)
    ![](https://img.onl/UZoRog)
    **RL :** 
    ![](https://img.onl/SnaF6n)
    ![](https://img.onl/mK5TAI)
    
    **AVL Tree: Deletion**
    1. Delete a node x as in a binary search tree and the last node deleted is a leaf
    2. Trace the path from the new leaf towards the root
    3. After we perform a rotation at x, we may have to perform a rotation at some ancestor of x

    **Rotations in Deletion**
    - There are 4 cases for single rotations, but we do not need to distinguish among them

    - There are exactly two cases for double rotations (as in the cases of insertion)

    - Therefore, we can reuse exactly the same procedure for insertion to determine which rotation to perform

- **Red-black Tree**

    - A red-black tree : 
        - Represent each 3-node and 4-node in a 2-3-4 tree as an equivalent binary search tree.
        - A binary search tree to represent a 2-3-4 tree.
        - Has the advantages of a 2-3-4 tree, without the storage overhead.
        
    **Splitting a 4-node on Red-black Tree**
    1. Parent is a 2-node: – Only change the colors : 
        1. to child: red -> black
        2. from parent: black -> red
    2. Parent is a 3-node : 
        1. Color change
        2. LL Rotation or RR Rotation or RL Rotation or LR Rotation
        
    **Red-Black Tree: Basics**
    - A binary search tree where each pointer is associated with a color, either red or black : 
        - External pointer (of a leaf) must be black
        - Every pointer to a new-added node must be red
        
    - Properties of external paths :
        - No consecutive red pointers
        - An equal number of black pointers

    **Red-Black Tree: Operations**
    - Searching and traversing a red-black tree :
        - Same algorithms as for a binary search tree

    - Insertion/deletion algorithms : 
        - Adjust the 2-3-4 tree algorithms to accommodate the red-black representation
        - In a red-black tree, splitting the equivalent of a 4-node requires only simple color changes
        - Pointer changes called rotations result in a shorter tree

    **Red-Black Tree: Insertion**
    - Main idea : 
        1. Splits of a node with two red pointers (like the 4-node in a 2-3-4 tree) occur only on the path from the root to a leaf (downward)!
        2. Set the pointer to a new-added node as red
        3. Rotate if there are two consecutive red pointers

    **Red-Black Tree: Deletion**
    - Main idea : 
        1. Find the node to delete, as in a binary search tree
            - two children -> swap with the in-order successor
            - Only one child -> pointed to by a black pointer
            - Leaf -> pointed to by a red or black pointer
        2. Replace the node of only one child with its child
        3. Delete the leaf if the pointer to it is red
        4. Recolor or rotate
            - Leaf pointed to by a black pointer
